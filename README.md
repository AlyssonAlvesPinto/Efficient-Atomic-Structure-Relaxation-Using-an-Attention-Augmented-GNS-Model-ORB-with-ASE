## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project provides a fast and accurate script for structural relaxation of atomic systems using the ORB modelâ€”an attention-augmented Graph Network-based Simulator (GNS) . ORB is a type of Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) that uses orbital features to predict forces and energies with high fidelity.

By leveraging ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment) and the pre-trained ORB force field, this script enables reliable relaxation of atomic structures, suitable for rapid screening or high-throughput simulations.


# ORB Structure Relaxation

Relax atomic structures using pre-trained neural network models from [ORB-models](https://github.com/orbital-materials/orb-models), integrated with the [Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE)](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/).


This project uses a pre-trained ORB model to perform structural relaxation on atomic systems. The relaxation process is carried out with the BFGS optimizer in ASE. It supports both CPU and CUDA devices.




































# Orbital-Based Relaxation with ORB Model and ASE

This project performs a structural relaxation using the pre-trained ORB (Orbital Regression Based) force field model in combination with the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE).

## ðŸ’ª Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* ASE
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* `orb_models` (from ORB GitHub repository)

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Create a virtual environment and install the required packages:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸ“‚ Files and Folders

* `data/structure.vasp` â€“ Input structure for relaxation.
* `src/relax_orb.py` â€“ Main Python script to perform structure relaxation.
* `outputs/` â€“ Contains the relaxed structure and plots.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Run the relaxation script:

```bash
python src/relax_orb.py
```

This will generate:

* `outputs/final_structure.vasp`
* `outputs/neb_relaxation_plots.pdf`
* `outputs/go_orb.traj`

## ðŸ“ˆ Output Example

The relaxation plot shows the evolution of maximum force per step:
